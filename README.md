# Chalk
***A Tiny Specific Domain Education Language built on top of Python.***

## The ChalkBoard System
### Chalk: The langauge that builds assignments easily.

### Board: The simple developer board you write with Chalk on.

### Carb: The file used to save and run Chalk programs.

## The Chalk Language
### Interpreted, Object-Oriented, Highest Level
The Chalk Langauge has only two objects, Lesson and Problem.

Lesson: A collection of problems.

Problem: Static or Dynamic Problems with visuals and help functions.

#### The following attributes are included
L[ ]: The lesson object. The brackets contain the namespace or name of the lesson.

L[US History Week 3]

Q[ ]: Is how we build the problem object. It must be built under a lesson object. It contains two inputs:
Name and Type. The type is written with T[] attribute.

Q[Who is the United States President?]

T[Multichoice]

### Chalk Tools
#### PDF Parser
Built on the back of legends (pdfplumber), if you have a pdf file of a textbook or problem set.
Parse and create new lessons from old materials.

#### Problem Designer
There are as many math, science, reading, writing, history and other problems as stars in the sky.
Sometimes we finish a set and need additional practice. So use chalk variable operators to add new life 
to old problems. Change names, location, numbers and facts. All with the Board Problem Designer.

#### Chalk Library
It is no fun doing the same thing over again. If you parse a pdf into a lesson, .carb file. Share it to the whole
world. So we can all learn together.

### How to Contribute
I am the sole developer of the Chalk and Board projects. If you want to help, send a pull request of a feature and If it works
I will add it to the master. Otherwise I may modify it to make it better suited to project, in which I will comment
it in the pull requests area. For those who help, I will create a txt document with their name and short description of the contribution.


We (currently just me) are seeing what Chalk/Board will look like. So there is no hard and fast rules yet.
